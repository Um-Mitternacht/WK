**Will run on Fabric, but because of this, should run fine on Quilt.**

**Will have compat for the following mods for viewing recipes:**

EMI

REI

**Will use the following dependencies if specific features never made it in in regards to attributes on 1.21.**

Step Height Attribute

Pehkui

Reach Entity Attributes

**Will use these mods as hard dependencies:**

Trinkets

Modonomicon

AzureLib

Mod Menu

Midnight Lib

Other mods may be needed

**Will have optional compat with the following:**

Appleskin

Origins + Apoli

**Possible further compat after a first release or so could include the following:**

Farmer's Delight

The Let's Do suite of mods

Various Farmer's Delight addons

And so on...

**The following mods will have sanity checks on this end to avoid issues. These will consist of things like making stuff
in the mod highly configurable.**

Nycto (whenever it drops, and if we do things like vampires and werewolves)

Bewitchment (Possibly?)

Various sanity checks with other mods that share this theme.

**All dependencies required for specific dependencies we add will also be included.**

**Minecraft version**

1.21.*, and we need to figure out how to completely rewrite the mod for said version. However, we can't lock down on a
specific version forever. We will need to go to 1.22 and beyond eventually.

**Other notes**

We should try and support the three main recipe viewers, REI, JEI, and EMI. As a result, the repo is built against them.
However, only JEI is turned on in worlds for testing.
