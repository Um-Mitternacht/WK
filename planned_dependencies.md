Will run on Fabric, but because of this, should run fine on Quilt.

Will have compat for the following mods for viewing recipes:

EMI
REI

Will use the following dependencies if specific features never made it in in regards to attributes on 1.21.*

Step Height Attribute
Pehkui
Reach Entity Attributes

Will use these mods as hard dependencies:

Trinkets
Modonomicon
AzureLib
Mod Menu
Cloth Config

Will have optional compat with the following:

Appleskin
Origins + Apoli

Possible further compat after a first release or so could include the following:

Farmer's Delight
The Let's Do suite of mods
Various Farmer's Delight addons
And so on...

The following mods will have sanity checks on this end to avoid issues. These will consist of things like making stuff in the mod highly configurable.

Nycto (whenever it drops, and if we do things like vampires and werewolves)
Bewitchment (Possibly?)

All dependencies required for specific dependencies we add will also be included.
