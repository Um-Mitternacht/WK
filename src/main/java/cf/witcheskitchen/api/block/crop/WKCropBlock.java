/**
 * <p>
 * A CropBlock represents a {@link Block} that can grow
 * and have different ages, which is represented as an {@link IntProperty}
 * with a certain range of numbers.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The <strong>WKCropBlock</strong> class wraps the {@link CropBlock} and removes the
 * default property of seven ages and instead provides a way of specifying a certain
 * age range for the crop.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In addition, this class provides abstraction for the age property
 * in order to setup the {@link StateManager.Builder} correctly
 * and some useful methods to determine the growing behaviour.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When your Block is a {@link CropBlock}, you need to make sure +
 * you provide the right model variants in the <strong>JSON</strong> file, whose
 * property identifier is <strong>ALWAYS</strong> fixed to <strong>"age"</strong>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * As an example, you could consider the following json model:
 * {
 * "variants": {
 * "age=0": {
 * "model": "modid:block/custom_crop_stage0"
 * },
 * "age=1": {
 * "model": "minecraft:block/custom_crop_stage1"
 * }
 * }
 * It declares a CropBlock with 2 ages, which means it will only have 2 stages
 * and will only be considered as matured when the {@link BlockState} returns
 * an {@link IntProperty} of age 1.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Do note that the age property of the crop always start at zero, no
 * matter what your max age is.
 * </p>
 *
 * <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>
 * If your {@link IntProperty} property has a maxAge > 7
 * you'll have to add a different {@link VoxelShape} that the one
 * provided by the parent class {@link CropBlock#getOutlineShape(BlockState, BlockView, BlockPos, ShapeContext)},
 * this is due the limitation of 7 ages that it has.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Due to the above mentioned this class is marked as abstract and cannot be instantiated
 * directly. You'll have to extend it and provide your own CropBlock implementation.
 * </p>
